## About

This application makes use of a javascript library called moment.js and a backend data processing application called firebase to maintain a list of user inputed train data and update the train arrival times. The user can add any train they want and input any destination they want to make a completely custom list. As long as the user inputs the arrival time of the first train of the day and the frequency of that train's arrivals, the application will always tell the user the time the next train will arrive in am/pm format as well as how many minutes away that train is from the current moment.
